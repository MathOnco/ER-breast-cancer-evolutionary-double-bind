This repository provides the MatLab and MUSYC code for the manuscript above. A summary of each folder:

## EGA
Matlab code to produce the figures describing the "Evolutionary Game Assay" in figures 4 and 5.

## Musyc
Files output by the [Musyc tool](https://musyc.lolab.xyz/) for inferring synergy, and Matlab code for visualizing the result, found in Table 1.

## Normalization
Matlab code to convert from fluorescence values to cell counts, used in all figures of spheroid cell counts.

##  Surface
Matlab code to produce the combination therapy surface plots in figure 2.

## Validation
Matlab code to produce the validation simulations and experimental data in figure 5.
